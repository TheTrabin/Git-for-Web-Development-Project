Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    You can't put block elements within an inline element.
    Inline are elements that only occupy space within tags.
    Block elements are overcompasing elements like a section or the entire page.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Position is set to that absolute position no matter what, including if the page resolution
    has changed, relative to the edges of the containing block.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of
     space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        Box Model. You would set the padding, Margin, border, Width of the container.
        Imagine it being a rectangle. Your content has it's own space needed.
        You can set the Height and Width of the container of content itself.
        Then you have internal Padding. This sets how much from the content the inner space 
        your content is surrounded with.
        Then there's the Border.
        And then the Margin, which sets how much space from the border the rest of the content
        of the page or other content can be close to your container.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements 
    that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    <Span> = Inline by default.
    <img> = inline by default.
    <button> = inline-block by default.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        Box Model definition can be found in Question 3.
        However, the Box model can break depending on Resulution and doesn't bend well.
        Border box will apply a natural box layout to all elements within.
        border-sizing: box-border { width, margin, etc}

        There are still things that will break, 
        but you can set the margin and width to a percent easier.
